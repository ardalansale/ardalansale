# Hi, I'm Ardalan

I'm a UX Designer and frontend developer who believes good code should be accessible, semantic, and readable.

## What drives me

- **Code as communication** — if it needs extensive comments, it probably needs refactoring
- **Design with empathy** — accessibility isn't a feature, it's a foundation

## My toolbox

**Core:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma, Tailwind, NextJS

**Workflow:** Git, VSCode 

**Philosophy:** User-centered design, Responsive design, WCAG compliance

## 🧠 Current focus

I'm building a portfolio that embodies minimalism where function leads and form follows. I create clean websites, motion graphics, and 3D visuals where every pixel is deliberate and every design choice has a reason.
